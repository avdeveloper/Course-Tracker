# CourseTracker - A software engineer project
(c)2013 Albert Villaroman <avdeveloper@gmail.com>

Designing the UX and coding the prototype for a school project where we are practicing the Agile development process.

This project is still ongoing so it is not yet complete.

Also take note that although we are using Bootstrap, we do not promote adding classes to the DOM to style them. That is not semantic practice. Therefore, we use Compass to use mixins instead.

## Tech Stack
* jQuery Framework for frontend JavaScript
* Node.js for a simple file server (for now)
* Ruby on Rails for actual backend
* MongoDB for data store (still to be implemented)
* Compass CSS framework with stylesheets written in SCSS
* Blueprint for grid system
* Bootstrap for initial design of components
